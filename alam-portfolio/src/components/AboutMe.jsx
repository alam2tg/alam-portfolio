			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hi, my name is Aaron Lam! This website tells the story of my career as a developer. I first coded in June of 2023 and decided to switch careers to web development. In my past life, I worked in finance/banking. Though finance is one of my passions, I have always had the itch to use my creativity and critical thinking in my daily life. After finally giving coding a shot, I thought it was the perfect path for me. Check out my projects form the Navbar, and feel free to reach out!
